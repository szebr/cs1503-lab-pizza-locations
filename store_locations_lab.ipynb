    "You own a pizza chain, and you collected data about pizza deliveries in a certain neighborhood. The data contains a coordinate of each delivery as a pair *(Latitude, Longitude)*. You do not have any stores in this neighborhood, and driving there each time is too expensive (especially with current gas prices). So you decide to open $K$ new stores in this area. The task is, based on the frequent delivery data, determine the best locations for the new stores.\n",

How would you choose the location of the store within each cluster that minimizes the overall distance between the store and each delivery address? __Explain your idea in a separate cell below.__"
